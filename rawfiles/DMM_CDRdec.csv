"Footnotes:"
"Rates from 1991 onward are based on the resident population concept. Before 1991, rates are based on the de facto population concept. Vitals data (births, deaths and marriages) is based on date of registration (not date of occurrence)."
"From September 1995, birth and death registrations collected ethnicity based on self-identification, rather than degree-of-blood."
"Deaths per 1,000 mean estimated population. Figures on Maori mortality should be used with caution."
